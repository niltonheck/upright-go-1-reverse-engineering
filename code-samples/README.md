# Code Samples

This directory contains some sample codes on how to interact with Upright GO 1 BLE device.

The main purpose is to work as a repository to make it easier to understand how to interact with the device.

These samples work in general for all sort of BLE-compatible devices, but the main focus is on Upright GO 1.

## THESE SAMPLES ARE PROBABLY NOT GOOD CODE SINCE IT WAS JUST FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO INTERACT WITH THE DEVICE :heart:
